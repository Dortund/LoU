In a fortunate turn of timing, Saruman the White has come back from his travels in the East and is proposing to take up residence in the citadel. He offers to fortify the tower and assist the West against further threats, be they orc or man. Both Steward Beren of Gondor and the King of Rohan are relieved at this offer and eagerly accept - turning the Key of Orthanc over to Saruman. In T.A. 2759 the valley in which Isengard resided soon became known as 'Nan Curunír', the 'Valley of Saruman' or the 'Wizard's Vale'. Optimistic locals are pouring into the area to open trade routes, help with construction, and provide investments for expansion. A formal 'Guard of Orthanc' has been established and is recruiting champions from Dunland, Adornland and Rohan to fill its ranks.

 LOU_Days_of_Dearth.1.t: "The Days of Dearth"
 LOU_Days_of_Dearth.1.d: "Famine is here. The Long Winter has been especially hard on the hobbits of the Shire and left its mark. Not only did we lose last Autumn's final harvest, but many food stores were exhausted with the five-month Winter we've endured. Worse, the massive amount of snowfall has begun melting and the resulting floods are destroying our fields and natural crops. The difficulties with spring-planting will again mean much lower crop yields. Wild game are becoming sparse looking for their own food to eat and livestock are starving from not enough feed. The region is now battling widespread food shortages that threaten life, trade, production, manpower, and overall availability of supplies. Rapidly rising food prices are beginning to cause inflation. Hobbits are starting to starve, and a general outcry has begun. Our Shirriffs have established some degree of autonomy to help mitigate problems locally on their own. Gandalf is moving about the region doing what he can to help, but even he is just one simple old wizard. We estimate it will take roughly one year to stabilize our trade, repair fields, replant crops, and import extra provisions from nearby Bree and Lindon. We fear that by that time thousands of hobbits will have died..."
 LOU_Days_of_Dearth.1.a: "Bleak times for the Shire"
 LOU_Days_of_Dearth.2.t: "The End of the Days of Dearth"
 LOU_Days_of_Dearth.2.d: "It has been a horrible year and a half for the Shire. First the Long Winter followed by a year of famine, resulting in the deaths of thousands of Shire hobbits. However, hope is truly on the horizon. Regular rains are filling our reservoirs, fertile soils are being tilled for planting, and sunny days are luring seeds into their leafy lives above. Prices have begun stabilizing with regular access to goods and the elves have even sent some gold as a gift to stabilize our economy. Mercenary from Bree and even a few Dunedain captains have offered to join our militias until our numbers recuperate as well. Furthermore, rumor is that Gandalf will be sticking around for a while - some say he is overtly fond of our pipeweed. We are happy for his presence; he warms the communities he visits - epecially with his fireworks! It shall be a fat and happy summer with many festivals and parties. Life is returning to normal 'round these parts."
 LOU_Days_of_Dearth.2.a: "We can have Second Breakfast again!"
 LOU_Palantir.1.t: "Possession of a Palantír"
 LOU_Palantir.1.d: "We have in our possession a Palantír from the golden era of Gondor. Likely constructed by Fëanor, the Eldar offered these as a gift of hope to King Amandil, just as the Shadow began to fall upon Númenor. When Elendil later fled Númenor he took seven with him - three went to Arnor and four went south to Gondor. These 'Seeing-Stones' utilized the silvan magic of ósanwë to allow mental communication between long distances and offered vision of the surrounding areas to those trained in their use. Surely if we look into it we will get us a glimpse of something..."
 LOU_Palantir.1.a: "This will be of great help to us... we think?"
 LOU_Angmar.1.t: "Re-Formation of the Kingdom of Angmar"
 LOU_Angmar.1.d: "We have secured the Angmarim borders of old. It is time to declare ourselves once more as the Kingdom of Angmar. The Witch-King will honor our achievement by returning to His throne at Carn Dûm and assuming command of our forces. With a Nazgûl once more leading our nation, surely the Dúnedain of Arnor will be extinguished for good."
 LOU_Angmar.1.a: "The North will tremble once more."

Elendil offered the title of 'Prince' to the leader of this family and named the region 'Dor-en-Ernil' in Sindarin, which translates to 'Land of the Prince'. In T.A. 1981 the elven King of Lorien, Amroth, drowned in the Bay of Belfalas and the nearby hill was named the Hill of Amroth in his honor. The elves soon departed and the Numenorean Prince who ruled, Galador, assumed control of the rest of the region and founded the 'Principality of Dol Amroth'. These men maintained their Numenorean legacy by building massive Carracks to defend the shores of Gondor, many of them with swan-prows in memory of the elves' own ships. No other fleet could quite match the strength of Dol Amroth's own navy, or meet the morale of their sailors when defending their homes."

 desc_renaissance: "In TA 2770, Smaug came from the mountains in the north, drawn by great wealth amassed by the Dwarven kingdom of the Lonely Mountain. For two centuries, Smaug ruled the Lonely Mountain uncontested, lying within the great treasure hoard of the Lonely Mountain and ensuring that no one entered the mountain in an attempt to steal from him. The surrounding domain became a scarred wasteland known to the Dwarves and men as the Desolation of Smaug."
 desc_new_world_i: "In T.A. 2770 Erebor was sacked by the Dragon Smaug. Many of the Dwarves of Durin's Folk were rendered homeless and wandered through western Middle-earth, trying to make as best a living they could. After some years of wandering they settled down in Dunland. Among these Dwarves were Thrór, formerly the King under the Mountain now King of Durin's folk in exile, his son Thráin II and grandson Thorin II who became later known as Thorin Oakenshield."
 desc_printing_press: "The White Council long feared the power in Dol Guldur might be Sauron, but Saruman opposed assaulting it. However, Gandalf later went to Dol Guldur himself and discovered that the Necromancer was indeed Sauron. He then informed the White Council, and Saruman was unable to protest. The White Council attacked Dol Guldur, and Sauron, not yet powerful enough to challenge them, fled to Mordor. Sauron continued to increase his power over the next 100 years in his search for the One Ring."

The men who loyally served Angmar became known as the 'Angmarim' and under orcish command they built cities up in the far North to house these diverse armies, as well as the even larger slave populations that performed the labors within. Today, the Lower Cities are the most populated cluster of Angmarim in the region and will provide a crucial economic base for our burgeoning tribe.

We have tamed the land as well; utilizing military engineers we have found convenient sections of mountain that we can build into and on top of as our fortress expands. We are able to work with the rugged land, rather than against it. Furthermore our laborers have cleared the high-altitude soils of rock and tapped into groundwater springs deep within the mountain. During the groundwater excavation we also discovered a healthy vein of iron that we have tapped for additional weapons and armor production.

In T.A. 1432, during the Kin-Strife, the Castamir rebels besieged and burned the city.

In T.A. 1409 Amon Sûl was razed by the Witch-King but the Palantír was smuggled out before its fall and brought to Fornost Erain, the capital of Arthedain. In T.A. 1974 the Witch-King captured Fornost, where two Palantír were then being stored. King Arvedui of Arthedain snuck back into the fortress-city and rescued many valuable Dúnedain heirlooms. They were soon spotted and chased away by the forces of Angmar, fleeing first to the Blue Mountains then northwards to Forochel hoping for the aid of the Lossoth during Winter. The snow peoples took pity on the Dúnedain, fearing also their weapons, and offered them food and shelter. Arvedui's son, Aranarth had escaped to Lindon and Cirdan, upon hearing of their isolation up north, sent a ship to rescue them. The ship made it through the winter seas and arrived in Forochel, much to the Lossoth people's surprise. However, the Lossoth Chief warned Arvedui from sailing away, saying of the Witch-King 'For in summer his power wanes; but now his breath is deadly, and his cold arm is long.' Despite the Lossoth Chief's warning, Arvedui sailed into the Sea of Forodwaith, along with his two Palantíri.

At the time of its construction, Orthanc stood at the northern edge of Gondor's territory and stood guard against orcs from the Misty Mountains and invaders from Enedwaith and Dunland. Its crucial position made it a natural choice for a seeing-stone. After the Great Plague of T.A. 1636 the Dúnedain of the area began to migrate eastward, eventually abandoning the tower and taking the Keys to Gondor's capital. Saruman correctly suspected the stone had been locked inside the tower for centuries, and he gained access to it in T.A. 2759 when Orthanc was surrendered to him by Gondor and Rohan."

It differed from the other stones as it could not communicate with them, but rather looked permanently westward towards the Master-stone in the Tower of Avallonë, on Tol Eressëa. This ensured the stone was safe to use, though far less practical. It was also called the 'Elendil Stone' as he was the only human known to use it, gazing westward towards the Undying Lands where he could still see the light and hope of Valinor. After the fall of Arnor the occasional band of wandering elves would stop by and gaze into the stone to try and catch glimpses of Varda, Queen of the Valar and Lady of the Stars."
