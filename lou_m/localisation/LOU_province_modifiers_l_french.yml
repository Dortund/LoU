 dol_guldur: "Dol Guldur"
 desc_dol_guldur: "Dol Guldur, or 'Hill of Sorcery' is the notorious home of the figure only known as 'The Necromancer'. Over the course of many centuries He has lived here; except when harassed by troubling Istari. Built on the Amon Lanc, or 'bald hill', this castle was built around T.A. 1000 after which the forest of Mirkwood began to corrupt and fester."

 necromancers_capital:"Necromancer's Capital"
 desc_necromancers_capital: "The Hill of Sorcery is once more the capital of the Necromancer. Having fled from Gandalf's investigation in T.A. 2063, He returned here in T.A. 2460 and began fortifying the lower levels of the tower and organizing large orc forces. It is of great importance to His operations in the region; only a great force could truly rout Him from this place. Dol Guldur has remained in a state of disrepair above ground to dissuade its enemies from thinking it is a true threat."

 rangers_of_ithilien: "Rangers of Ithilien"
 desc_rangers_of_ithilien: ""

 telain_defenses: "Telain Defenses"
 desc_telain_defenses: "Coming from the Sindarin word 'talan', which means 'platform', the 'Telain' are a series of defensive flets built high up in the Mallorn trees of Lothlórien. They are accessible only by retractable ladders and are actively defended by the the Marchwardens of the Galadhrim. Most Telain are impossible to detect or see from below, making them excellent stealth defense positions. It is no easy task to assault Lothlórien due to this vigilant and secretive guard."

 mallorn_trees: "Mallorn Trees"
 desc_mallorn_trees: "Descended from Valinor, these massive trees were inhabited by the wood elves of Lothlórien. Over time the Galadhrim mastered the craft of both growing and building within the Mallorn boughs once the trees were large enough. Mallorn leaves were used to wrap lembas while their bark was transformed into Hithlain - a robust, silky, flexible and light fibre used in ropes and clothing."

 fangorn_forest: "Fangorn Forest"
 desc_fangorn_forest: "Fangorn is Sindarin for 'Treebeard'. This dark and haunted forest is extremely difficult to navigate, let alone march an army through. Locals say that those who enter do not come out and that the forest itself punishes those who trespass."

 drughu_wildmen: "Drughu Wildmen"
 desc_drughu_wildmen: "The Drughu peoples live much more wildly and naturally with the world than their more civilized neighbors. Their settlements are not typical as they instead prefer to live in makeshift tents deep within hidden forests and jungles, or inside of secret caves in more hilly or mountainous terrain. They are natural pathfinders and poison-makers, making them skilled defenders of their homes."

 days_of_dearth: "The Days of Dearth"
 desc_days_of_dearth: "The worst famine in recorded Shire history."

 half_trollmen_desert_nomads: "Half Troll-Men Desert Nomads"
 desc_half_trollmen_desert_nomads: "The Half Troll-men of Far Harad are shrouded in mystery. They are known to be adept at surviving in the harshest terrain of the south, leading them to a reclusive and nomadic lifestyle. They are only found thriving where other species cannot. Half-trolls have a legacy of serving Sauron and will only depart their wasteland homes to fight under threat or pay from the Dark Lord Himself."

 halfling_farmers: "Halfling Farmers"
 desc_halfling_farmers: "This province is exceptionally fertile and the local hobbits are taking advantage and planting extra crops wherever they can. They are also setting up local councils to help oversee the extra production and to manage affairs locally - this means a little autonomy in exchange for lower costs and more goods to trade. It also means extra time for locals to delight in food, drink and smoke!"

 himring_fortress_ruins: "Fortress of Himring Ruins"
 desc_himring_fortress_ruins: "The Fortress of Himring was built by the Sons of Fëanor and served as the primary defense of the ancient 'March of Maedhros'. This fortification survived the Dagor Bragollach but either fell or was abandoned during the Nirnaeth Arnoediad. During the War of Wrath the surrounding lowland plains were flooded by the torrent of the incoming ocean while Himring's mountain top was battered and broken by the harsh weather. Only the top of Himring's highest peak remained as a lonely island amidst the vast new ocean waters.  \n\nSome ruined parapets, walls and structures of the original stronghold still exist here and remain semi-defensible. The marred and rocky terrain is difficult to work, however."

 himring_fortress_rebuilt: "Fortress of Himring Rebuilt"
 desc_himring_fortress_rebuilt: "The Fortress of Himring was built by the Sons of Fëanor and served as the primary defense of the ancient 'March of Maedhros'. This fortification survived the Dagor Bragollach but either fell or was abandoned during the Nirnaeth Arnoediad. During the War of Wrath the surrounding lowland plains were flooded by the torrent of the incoming ocean while Himring's mountain top was battered and broken by the harsh weather. Only the top of Himring's highest peak remained as a lonely island amidst the vast new ocean waters. \n\nWe have built up the ancient parapets and restored the walls. The former structures of the original stronghold have been rebuilt and reinforced. The fortress has now been updated to accommodate the formal needs of a proper garrison and a defensive fighting force. We have tamed the land as well; utilizing military engineers we have found convenient sections of mountain that we can build into and on top of as our fortress expands. We are able to work with the rugged land, rather than against it. Furthermore our laborers have cleared the high-altitude soils of rock and tapped into groundwater springs deep within the mountain. During the groundwater excavation we also discovered a healthy vein of iron that we have tapped for additional weapons and armor production. The days of Himring's glory have returned - Maedhros of Beleriand would be proud of our restoration."

 stone_of_the_hapless: "Stone of the Hapless"
 desc_stone_of_the_hapless: "Also known as the Standing Stone, this rock marks the burial location of Túrin Turambar, his sister Niënor, and their mother Morwen. The rock has an inscription that reads 'TÚRIN TURAMBAR DAGNIR GLAURUNGA' - Túrin, Master of Fate, Slayer of Glaurung. His sister's name, NIËNOR NÍNIEL, is also engraved beneath. It is a somber place, echoing the tragedy of the children of Húrin, whose fates were inescapable. It is one of only a few well-known tragedies of Middle-Earth to survive from the First Age."

 spider_webs: "Spider Webs"
 desc_spider_webs: "The presence of spiders in this region has resulted in webs being spun all over. These will trap and slow our enemies, allowing the spiders to passively feed on them while also affording us an advantage during ambushes. A few of our own local patrols will likely end up disappearing in these webs as well, but is surely worth the sacrifice."

 forest_huorns: "Huorns of the Forest"
 desc_forest_huorns: "Huorns are extremely dangerous tree-type beings that exist somewhere between the consciousness of an Ent and a normal tree. They resemble trees even more than the Ents do and lack any sort of humanoid features. They blend in with other trees and can be devastatingly destructive to unwanted intruders of their territory. Huorns have the ability to move using their roots to 'crawl' along the ground; they can also use their roots to bury their enemies beneath them to be crushed and 'devoured'. They are capable of understanding the commands of Ents and make their own croaking and groaning noises similar to the sounds of a forest during a windstorm. As long as they are in a forested region they they will roam the region as self-sufficient creatures."

 desc_cair_andros: ""

 palantir: "Palantír"
 desc_palantir: ""

 osgiliath_stone: "Palantír - The Osgiliath-Stone"
 desc_osgiliath_palantir: "This Palantír was placed in Osgiliath, the ancient capital of Gondor. It was the largest of the stones, too large and heavy for a single person to lift. It was further unique, being the only Palantír that could secretly listen to communications between the users of the other stones. In T.A. 1432, during the Kin-Strife, the Castamir rebels besieged and burned the city. The Dome of Stars which contained the Palantír burned down and the stone was lost to the waters of the Anduin in the ensuing chaos. Many suspect it washed out to the Bay of Belfalas centuries ago."

 amon_sul_stone: "Palantír - The Amon Sûl-Stone"
 desc_amon_sul_palantir: "This Palantír was placed in Amon Sûl, one of Elendil's original watchtowers built along the East Road to protect Arnor. This stone would have offered view over the regions of the north from which orcs, trolls, and hillmen would descend. In T.A. 1409 Amon Sûl was razed by the Witch-King but the Palantír was smuggled out before its fall and brought to Fornost Erain, the capital of Arthedain. In T.A. 1974 the Witch-King captured Fornost, where two Palantír were then being stored. King Arvedui of Arthedain snuck back into the fortress-city and rescued many valuable Dúnedain heirlooms. They were soon spotted and chased away by the forces of Angmar, fleeing first to the Blue Mountains then northwards to Forochel hoping for the aid of the Lossoth during Winter. The snow peoples took pity on the Dúnedain, fearing also their weapons, and offered them food and shelter. Arvedui's son, Aranarth had escaped to Lindon and Cirdan, upon hearing of their isolation up north, sent a ship to rescue them. The ship made it through the winter seas and arrived in Forochel, much to the Lossoth people's surprise. However, the Lossoth Chief warned Arvedui from sailing away, saying of the Witch-King 'For in summer his power wanes; but now his breath is deadly, and his cold arm is long.' Despite the Lossoth Chief's warning, Arvedui sailed into the Sea of Forodwaith, along with his two Palantíri. Upon setting sail a wind from the North blew down and the hull of the ship was broken on the sea ice, sinking the ship and all within it"

 annuminas_stone: "Palantír - The Annúminas-Stone "
 desc_annuminas_palantir: "This Palantír was placed in Annúminas, the ancient capital of Arnor. This stone would have afforded immediate communciation between the royal family members split between Arnor and Gondor. After the death of the last King of Arnor, Eärendur, in T.A. 861 this stone was moved to the capital of the newly proclaimed capital of Arthedain, Fornost Erain. In T.A. 1974 the Witch-King captured Fornost, where two Palantír were then being stored. King Arvedui of Arthedain snuck back into the fortress-city and rescued many valuable Dúnedain heirlooms. They were soon spotted and chased away by the forces of Angmar, fleeing first to the Blue Mountains then northwards to Forochel hoping for the aid of the Lossoth during Winter.

Despite the Lossoth Chief's warning, Arvedui sailed into the Sea of Forodwaith, along with his two Palantíri and his men. Upon setting sail a wind from the North blew down and the hull of the ship was broken on the sea ice, sinking the ship and everything within."

 ithil_stone: "Palantír - The Ithil-Stone"
 desc_ithil_stone: "This Palantír was placed in Minas Ithil - now known as Minas Morgul. In T.A. 2002 when the Nazgûl seized the city the stone fell into the hands of Sauron, who began to use it to manipulate and sway the users of the other Palantíri. It rests secretly at Barad-dûr, accessible only to the Dark Lord."

 anor_stone: "Palantír - The Anor-Stone"
 desc_anor_stone: "This Palantír was placed in Minas Anor - now known as Minas Tirith. Its existence became mostly a secret following Eärnur's disappearance in T.A. 2050. Traditionally only the Stewards of Gondor had access to it."

 orthanc_stone: "Palantír - The Orthanc-Stone"
 desc_orthanc_stone: "This Palantír was placed in Orthanc. At the time of its construction, Orthanc stood at the northern edge of Gondor's territory and stood guard against orcs from the Misty Mountains and invaders from Enedwaith and Dunland. Its crucial position made it a natural choice for a seeing-stone. After the Great Plague of T.A. 1636 the Dúnedain of the area began to migrate eastward, eventually abandoning the tower and taking the Keys to Gondor's capital. Saruman correctly suspected the stone had been locked inside the tower for centuries, and he gained access to it in T.A. 2759 when Orthanc was surrendered to him by Gondor and Rohan."

 elostirion_stone: "Palantír - The Elostirion-Stone"
 desc_elostirion_stone: "This Palantír was placed in Elostirion. It differed from the other stones as it could not communicate with them, but rather looked permanently westward towards the Master-stone in the Tower of Avallonë, on Tol Eressëa. This ensured the stone was safe to use, though far less practical. It was also called the 'Elendil Stone' as he was the only human known to use it, gazing westward towards the Undying Lands where he could still see the light and hope of Valinor. After the fall of Arnor the occasional band of wandering elves would stop by and gaze into the stone to try and catch glimpses of Varda, Queen of the Valar and Lady of the Stars."
