 capital_at_carn_dum_title: "Capital at Carn Dûm"
 capital_at_carn_dum_desc: "Carn Dûm is without doubt the most powerful and fearsome fort this far north in Middle-Earth. Furthermore, it is the ancient capital of the Kingdom of Angmar. No matter who wins the war for regional power, only those who rule from Carn Dûm will have rights to restoring Angmar in title and glory."

 vale_of_nan_angmar_title: "Vale of Nan Angmar"
 vale_of_nan_angmar_desc: "The orcs of the Misty Mountains primarily flow into our realm through the Vale of Nan Angmar. We should secure the vale and build further housing for orcish troops to encourage their immigration into our nation."

 reformation_of_angmar_title: "Re-Formation of Angmar"
 reformation_of_angmar_desc: "It is time to re-form the ancient Witch-Kingdom of Angmar and begin our proper dominion over Eriador."

 angmarim_servitude_title: "Angmarim Servitude"
 angmarim_servitude_desc: "The corrupted Númenóreans who once served us have split their loyalties amongst various orc chieftains in the area. Let us crush these pretenders and unite the Angmarim cities in their service to Angmar."

 restore_old_borders_title: "Restore Old Borders"
 restore_old_borders_desc: "Our domain once occupied the entirety of the Nan Angmar valley down through the confluence of its westward-running rivers. No orc or man shall live in this place unless they answer to Angmar!"

 return_of_the_witch_king_title: "Return of the Witch-King"
 return_of_the_witch_king_desc: "We have restored the Witch-Kingdom of Angmar to its former lands and ancient glory - but declaring ourselves as Angmar does not fully make it so. Our true King is not yet restored to His throne. It is time to appeal the 'Necromancer' and request that our former ruler, the Witch-King of Angmar, depart from Minas Morgul and return to His command in the North."

 subjugate_mount_gram_title: "Subjugate Mount Gram"
 subjugate_mount_gram_desc: "Mount Gram has long been filled with goblins bold enough to raid the lowlands of Arthedain. It is also home to many packs of seasoned and well-trained wargs. The goblins here dared to declare an orc named Golfimbul their own 'King' in T.A. 2747. This King Golfimbul died that same year when his hasty invasion of the Shire failed due to the efforts of Bandobras "the Bullroarer" Took. These mountain goblins need proper leadership if any of us plan to rout the humans or hobbits for good. Let us bring them under command of a true king - a Witch-King."

 west_to_forochel_title: "West to Forochel"
 west_to_forochel_desc: "Forochel was never conquered by Angmar of old, which left Carn Dûm free to be marched upon from its westward front. We will rectify this vulnerability and begin securing territory in this region. It would be wise to first capture and coerce some local Lossoth into our service. As they scout the region, we can begin begin moving Angmarim into the territory and setting up a proper warcamp for further expansion."

 south_to_rhudaur_title: "South to Rhudaur"
 south_to_rhudaur_desc: "In T.A. 1349 King Argeleb I of Arthedain tried to claim Kingshop over all of Arnor, but Rhudaur refused to bend the knee. These 'Hill-men', no longer of Dúnedain heritage, had secretly allied themselves to Angmar with promises of land to take and cities to pillage throughout Cardolan and Arthedain. \n\nThrough diplomacy or war, we must ensure their service to the Witch-Kingdom of Angmar once more. They will swear fealty to our realm if we are allied and they have sufficient trust in us. If diplomacy is no longer an option we must seize their regional capitals as a show of force, at which point the remaining hill-men will swear loyalty out of fear and desperation."

 ice_bay_thralls_title: "Ice Bay Thralls"
 ice_bay_thralls_desc: "In T.A. 1974 King Arvedui of the Dúnedain took refuge at the Ice Bay of Forochel during his flight from Angmar's assault. He was sheltered there by the Lossoth and the next spring rescued by the elves of Lindon. We should enslave the Lossoth for aiding the Dúnedain long ago and seize their ports so as to prevent any elves sailing so far north again. Some of our own Angmarim will take over ruling these settlements and start turning them into profitable centers of trade and recruitment."

 the_naval_north_title: "The Naval North"
 the_naval_north_desc: "To secure our position in the north we must adapt to naval combat. We should build three primary ports in Forochel from which to construct, maintain and direct our fleet. We can immediately utilize these settlements as regional recruitment centers for sailors - both human and orc. A recruitment call and slave order will be issued to all those capable of serving in a new fleet and we will begin housing them at the appropriate harbors."

 a_frozen_fleet_title: "A Frozen Fleet"
 a_frozen_fleet_desc: "We have a large population of Lossoth slaves from our conquest of the Ice Bay - most of them are competent ship-builders and sailors alike. With their skills and training we can construct a fleet capable of dominating the Sea of Forochel. However, our orc forces are absolutely refusing to board a ship over the open sea, let alone the treacherous icy waters of Forochel. An alternative has presented itself - with the promise of booty from coastal raids our Angmarim men have begun eagerly signing up for naval service."

 ice_floes_of_forochel_title: "Ice Floes of Forochel"
 ice_floes_of_forochel_desc: "The Ice Bay is named for its neverending ice floes that come off the glaciers of the Northern Wastes. They are notoriously difficult to navigate and require adept seafaring scouts to determine sailing routes. \n\nWith the return of the Witch-King the winters here have become increasingly harsh and are lasting longer too. It is clear that the power of His morgul-sorcery is beginning to affect the environment permanently. The ice floes are the heaviest they've ever been and the shorelines are now protected by sharp, floating shards year-round. The ever-changing nature of the floes will take a hard toll on foreign fleets who do dare travel through the area, making naval invasions an absolute nightmare. Only the seasoned sailors who grew up in the region will know how to safely navigate these coasts. We dare Círdan and his elf-fleet to attempt a landing this far north again..."
