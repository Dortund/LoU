Elendil offered the title of 'Prince' to the leader of this family and named the region 'Dor-en-Ernil' in Sindarin, which translates to 'Land of the Prince'. In T.A. 1981 the elven King of Lorien, Amroth, drowned in the Bay of Belfalas and the nearby hill was named the Hill of Amroth in his honor. The elves soon departed and the Numenorean Prince who ruled, Galador, assumed control of the rest of the region and founded the 'Principality of Dol Amroth'. These men maintained their Numenorean legacy by building massive Carracks to defend the shores of Gondor, many of them with swan-prows in memory of the elves' own ships. No other fleet could quite match the strength of Dol Amroth's own navy, or meet the morale of their sailors when defending their homes."
