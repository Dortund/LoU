The Dunedain favored the large hulls and multiple-decks of these ships as large numbers of sailors, troops and supplies could be put to sea on long-term voyages or deployed in assault on foreign harbors.

Angmarrim, Rhudaurian, Dunlander, Southron, Easterling and Black Numenorean peoples are all raiders by tradition as well. On the rare occasion a dragon may go sit on someone else's stockpiled wealth and declare it their own plunder. It is also rumored that untouched Numenorean tombs may be full of various treasures, though other surprises may await those who go seeking them."
