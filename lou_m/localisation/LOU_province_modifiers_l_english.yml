 dead_marshes_modifier: "The Dead Marshes"
 desc_dead_marshes_modifier: "'All dead, all rotten.... The Dead Marshes. There was a great battle long ago, yes, so they told him when Sméagol was young, when I was young before the Precious came. It was a great battle. Tall Men with long swords, and terrible Elves, and Orcses shrieking. They fought on the plain for days and months at the Black Gates. But the Marshes have grown since then, swallowed up the graves; always creeping, creeping.' - Gollum                     The Dead Marshes are the uninhabitable wetlands where part of the Battle of Dagorlad occurred. They are entirely uninhabitable, and most claim they are haunted."
 
 dol_guldur: "Dol Guldur"
 desc_dol_guldur: "Dol Guldur, or 'Hill of Sorcery' is the notorious home of the figure only known as 'The Necromancer'. Over the course of many centuries He has lived here; except when harassed by troubling Istari. Built on the Amon Lanc, or 'bald hill', this castle was built around T.A. 1000 after which the forest of Mirkwood began to corrupt and fester."

 harad_trade_route: "Harad Trade Route"
 desc_harad_trade_route: "This trade route travels the southern outskirts of the Harad Wastes. It is the quickest route from Umbar in the West to Harshandatt in the East. The route is lightly populated among its scattered oases. The occasional Mûmakil caravan can be seen travelling these provinces with large stockpiles of goods on their backs."

 isengard: "Isengard"
 desc_isengard: ""

 rhosgobel: "Rhosgobel"
 desc_rhosgobel: "Rhosgobel is Sindarin in origin; rhosc meaning 'russet' or 'brown' and gobel meaning 'walled house' or 'town'. It is likely it was named thus due to the Brown Wizard, who chose this location as his permanent residence. It is a forested area, semi-hidden and difficult to navigate due to intentional overgrowth and istari magics."

 henneth_annun: "Henneth Annûn"
 desc_henneth_annun: "In T.A. 2901 an influx of orcs pressed the last human inhabitants of Ithilien into Gondor. At this time Steward Túrin II had a series of secret outposts and refuges constructed to aid in the defence of the region - the most successful, secretive, and longest maintained was Henneth Annûn. Occupying a hidden cave network with a bottleneck approach, it was highly defensible in case of emergency. Its location allowed the Rangers of Ithilien a formal base of operations for their forays against orc patrols."

 telain_defenses: "Telain Defenses"
 desc_telain_defenses: "Coming from the Sindarin word 'talan', which means 'platform', the 'Telain' are a series of defensive flets built high up in the Mallorn trees of Lothlórien. They are accessible only by retractable ladders and are actively defended by the the Marchwardens of the Galadhrim. Most Telain are impossible to detect or see from below, making them excellent stealth defense positions. It is no easy task to assault Lothlórien due to this vigilant and secretive guard."

 cerin_amroth: "Cerin Amroth"
 desc_cerin_amroth: "'Amroth's Mound' is a Mallorn-covered hill named after Amroth the King of Lórien who lived amongst the trees in the same fashion as the Silvan elves. Most of Lothlórien was visible here from the highest platform, as was Dol Guldur in Southern Mirkwood."

 caras_galadhon: "Caras Galadhon"
 desc_caras_galadhon: ""

 mallorn_trees: "Mallorn Trees"
 desc_mallorn_trees: "Descended from Valinor, these massive trees were inhabited by the wood elves of Lothlórien. Over time the Galadhrim mastered the craft of both growing and building within the Mallorn boughs once the trees were large enough. Mallorn leaves were used to wrap lembas while their bark was transformed into Hithlain - a robust, silky, flexible and light fibre used in ropes and clothing."

 fangorn_forest: "Fangorn Forest"
 desc_fangorn_forest: "Fangorn is Sindarin for 'Treebeard'. This dark and haunted forest is extremely difficult to navigate, let alone march an army through. Locals say that those who enter do not come out and that the forest itself punishes those who trespass."

 long_winter_mild: "The Long Winter - Mild"
 desc_long_winter_mild: "The effects of the Long winter are felt here, though not as intensely as other places."

 desc_long_winter_severe: "The effects of the Long Winter have hit here the most severely."

 drughu_wildmen: "Drughu Wildmen"
 desc_drughu_wildmen: "The Drughu peoples live much more wildly and naturally with the world than their more civilized neighbors. Their settlements are not typical as they instead prefer to live in makeshift tents deep within hidden forests and jungles, or inside of secret caves in more hilly or mountainous terrain. They are natural pathfinders and poison-makers, making them skilled defenders of their homes."

 days_of_dearth: "The Days of Dearth"
 desc_days_of_dearth: "The worst famine in recorded Shire history."

 himring_fortress_ruins: "Fortress of Himring Ruins"
 desc_himring_fortress_ruins: "The Fortress of Himring was built by the Sons of Fëanor and served as the primary defense of the ancient 'March of Maedhros'. This fortification survived the Dagor Bragollach but either fell or was abandoned during the Nirnaeth Arnoediad. During the War of Wrath the surrounding lowland plains were flooded by the torrent of the incoming ocean while Himring's mountain top was battered and broken by the harsh weather. Only the top of Himring's highest peak remained as a lonely island amidst the vast new ocean waters. Some ruined parapets, walls and structures of the original stronghold still exist here and remain semi-defensible. The marred and rocky terrain is difficult to work here."

 spider_webs: "Spider Webs"
 desc_spider_webs: "The presence of spiders in this region has resulted in webs being spun all over. These will trap and slow our enemies, allowing the spiders to passively feed on them while also affording us an advantage during ambushes. A few of our own local patrols will likely end up disappearing in these webs as well, but is surely worth the sacrifice."

 forest_huorns: "Huorns of the Forest"
 desc_forest_huorns: "Huorns are extremely dangerous tree-type beings that exist somewhere between the consciousness of an Ent and a normal tree. They resemble trees even more than the Ents do and lack any sort of humanoid features. They blend in with other trees and can be devastatingly destructive to unwanted intruders of their territory. Huorns have the ability to move using their roots to 'crawl' along the ground; they can also use their roots to bury their enemies beneath them to be crushed and 'devoured'. They are capable of understanding the commands of Ents and make their own croaking and groaning noises similar to the sounds of a forest during a windstorm. As long as they are in a forested region they they will roam the region as self-sufficient creatures."

 osgiliath_stone: "Palantír - The Osgiliath-Stone"
 desc_osgiliath_palantir: "This Palantír was placed in Osgiliath, the ancient capital of Gondor. It was the largest of the stones, too large and heavy for a single person to lift. It was further unique, being the only Palantír that could secretly listen to communications between the users of the other stones. In T.A. 1432, during the Kin-Strife, the Castamir rebels besieged and burned the city. The Dome of Stars which contained the Palantír burned down and the stone was lost to the waters of the Anduin in the ensuing chaos. Many suspect it washed out to the Bay of Belfalas centuries ago."

 amon_sul_stone: "Palantír - The Amon Sûl-Stone"
 desc_amon_sul_palantir: "This Palantír was placed in Amon Sûl, one of Elendil's original watchtowers built along the East Road to protect Arnor. This stone would have offered view over the regions of the north from which orcs, trolls, and hillmen would descend. In T.A. 1409 Amon Sûl was razed by the Witch-King but the Palantír was smuggled out before its fall and brought to Fornost Erain, the capital of Arthedain. In T.A. 1974 the Witch-King captured Fornost, where two Palantír were then being stored. King Arvedui of Arthedain snuck back into the fortress-city and rescued many valuable Dúnedain heirlooms. They were soon spotted and chased away by the forces of Angmar, fleeing first to the Blue Mountains then northwards to Forochel hoping for the aid of the Lossoth during Winter. The snow peoples took pity on the Dúnedain, fearing also their weapons, and offered them food and shelter. Arvedui's son, Aranarth had escaped to Lindon and Cirdan, upon hearing of their isolation up north, sent a ship to rescue them. The ship made it through the winter seas and arrived in Forochel, much to the Lossoth people's surprise. However, the Lossoth Chief warned Arvedui from sailing away, saying of the Witch-King 'For in summer his power wanes; but now his breath is deadly, and his cold arm is long.' Despite the Lossoth Chief's warning, Arvedui sailed into the Sea of Forodwaith, along with his two Palantíri. Upon setting sail a wind from the North blew down and the hull of the ship was broken on the sea ice, sinking the ship and all within it"

 annuminas_stone: "Palantír - The Annúminas-Stone "
 desc_annuminas_palantir: "This Palantír was placed in Annúminas, the ancient capital of Arnor. This stone would have afforded immediate communciation between the royal family members split between Arnor and Gondor. After the death of the last King of Arnor, Eärendur, in T.A. 861 this stone was moved to the capital of the newly proclaimed capital of Arthedain, Fornost Erain. In T.A. 1974 the Witch-King captured Fornost, where two Palantír were then being stored. King Arvedui of Arthedain snuck back into the fortress-city and rescued many valuable Dúnedain heirlooms. They were soon spotted and chased away by the forces of Angmar, fleeing first to the Blue Mountains then northwards to Forochel hoping for the aid of the Lossoth during Winter. The snow peoples took pity on the Dúnedain, fearing also their weapons, and offered them food and shelter.

Despite the Lossoth Chief's warning, Arvedui sailed into the Sea of Forodwaith, along with his two Palantíri and his men. Upon setting sail a wind from the North blew down and the hull of the ship was broken on the sea ice, sinking the ship and everything within."

 ithil_stone: "Palantír - The Ithil-Stone"
 desc_ithil_stone: "This Palantír was placed in Minas Ithil - now known as Minas Morgul. In T.A. 2002 when the Nazgûl seized the city the stone fell into the hands of Sauron, who began to use it to manipulate and sway the users of the other Palantíri. It rests secretly at Barad-dûr, accessible only to the Dark Lord."

 anor_stone: "Palantír - The Anor-Stone"
 desc_anor_stone: "This Palantír was placed in Minas Anor - now known as Minas Tirith. Its existence became mostly a secret following Eärnur's disappearance in T.A. 2050. Traditionally only the Stewards of Gondor had access to it."

 orthanc_stone: "Palantír - The Orthanc-Stone"
 desc_orthanc_stone: "This Palantír was placed in Orthanc. At the time of its construction, Orthanc stood at the northern edge of Gondor's territory and stood guard against orcs from the Misty Mountains and invaders from Enedwaith and Dunland. Its crucial position made it a natural choice for a seeing-stone. After the Great Plague of T.A. 1636 the Dúnedain of the area began to migrate eastward, eventually abandoning the tower and taking the Keys to Gondor's capital. Saruman correctly suspected the stone had been locked inside the tower for centuries, and he gained access to it in T.A. 2759 when Orthanc was surrendered to him by Gondor and Rohan."

 elostirion_stone: "Palantír - The Elostirion-Stone"
 desc_elostirion_stone: "This Palantír was placed in Elostirion. It differed from the other stones as it could not communicate with them, but rather looked permanently westward towards the Master-stone in the Tower of Avallonë, on Tol Eressëa. This ensured the stone was safe to use, though far less practical. It was also called the 'Elendil Stone' as he was the only human known to use it, gazing westward towards the Undying Lands where he could still see the light and hope of Valinor. After the fall of Arnor the occasional band of wandering elves would stop by and gaze into the stone to try and catch glimpses of Varda, Queen of the Valar and Lady of the Stars."
