#  copper:0 "Copper"
#  copperDESC:0 "Copper has a wide variety of uses in the Third Age. While Iron is responsible for most arms and armor production, copper and brass has taken the role of more utilitarian use. It is durable enough for making work tools like axes, adzes and chisels, and can be shaped small enough to make excellent surgical instruments like needles and tweezers. Its availability globally makes it a viable metal for currency between most cultures. Copperware like pots, pans and bowls are another popular product, as are are the reliable and malleable pipes used for irrigation and sewage in more civilized regions.

#  gold:0 "Gold"
#  goldDESC:0 "Gold is a rare but very valuable resource in Middle-Earth; most reserves of it are found deep beneath large and ancient mountain ranges. The dwarves excel above all others at finding and tapping these veins, though all races are able to mine it. Its primary purpose is serving as high-value currency, but is also largely utilized as decoration and adornment in aristocratic courts, palaces and warcamps. It is not uncommon to see the warriors of Harad and their Oliphaunts adorned in pieces of gold jewelry. Dwarven halls, weapons and armors are commonly inlaid with gold. The warriors of Rhun often smelt a fine layer of gold leaf into their armors in imitation of gold-covered dragon scales."

#  salt:0 "Salt"
#  saltDESC:0 "Salt is essential for all animals to survive in Arda. It is also extremely useful for preserving food for the long winter months, or for the upcoming war-march. Its mineral form is mined from most of the many mountain ranges across Middle-Earth, though it is a semi-rare resource compared to iron and copper.

It is much more common to see paper used amongst scholars, administrators, wizards and elves. The only places that accrue books are typically places of high government like Minas Tirith, or places of old knowledge and learning like Rivendell or Isengard.

Sometimes a single piece of parchment will hold a secret to an entire destiny; such is the true value of paper in Middle-Earth."

#  gems:0 "Gems"
#  gemsDESC:0 "The gems of Middle-Earth are buried deep under tall mountains, but for those who go digging they may find topaz, amethysts, jade, rubies, sapphires, emeralds and diamonds.

Existing only in rumor to the peoples of the West, in the South they were tamed, cultivated and trained to be war machines. The southerners who mastered these beasts, the Mahud, placed large war towers on the backs of Mumakil, filled them with Haradric archers, and rode the beasts to the frontlines of war. It was incredibly difficult to kill, let alone stop, a Mumakil in full rampage."

#  corsairs: "Corsairs"
#  corsairsDESC: "The Corsairs were a large, organized fleet of pirates based primarily out of the Bay of Umbar. Being of Black Numenorean heritage meant Umbareans were competent ship-builders and sailors. Their navy was built of some of the finest ships constructed outside Gondor. Though not as large as Gondor's carracks, their ships' smaller size and sleeker design made them faster and more maneuverable, allowing them to evade pursuers and inflict devastating damage whilst raiding enemy coasts. It was bragged they could sink even Dol Amroth's prestigious Carracks - under the right admiralty and assault tactics."

#  carracks: "Numenorean Carracks"
#  carracksDESC: "The Numenorean Carracks of Gondor and Dol Amroth are built in the same fashion as those of ancient Numenor during its golden era. Though there are far fewer these days, a few major ports of the Dunedain still build and harbor fleets of these Grand Carracks. The Dunedain favored the large hulls and multiple-decks of these ships as large numbers of sailors, troops and supplies could be put to sea on long-term voyages or deployed in assault on foreign harbors. Lengthy sea patrols were also possible to protect shores from invaders before they neared Gondor's vulnerable trade lanes and exposed coasts. While many ships in Middle-Earth were capable of raiding their neighbors, only the Numenorean Carracks could truly dominate the high seas."

Goblins are the most notorious pillagers in Middle-Earth, though all orc types and trolls are known for building up piles of plunder. Angmarrim, Rhudaurian, Dunlander, Southron, Easterling and Black Numenorean peoples are all raiders by tradition as well. On the rare occasion a dragon may go sit on someone else's stockpiled wealth and declare it their own plunder. It is also rumored that untouched Numenorean tombs may be full of various treasures that could also be plundered, though other surprises may await those who go seeking them. *Plunder operates the same as gold but is half as productive.*"
