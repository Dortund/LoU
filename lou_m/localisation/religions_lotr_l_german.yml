Therefore, he made the first seven Fathers of the Dwarves in secret, in a hall under the mountains of Middle-earth. It was, however, not within Aulë's power to create life. After being reprimanded by Ilúvatar for creating them, and realizing his error, Aulë prepared to destroy his creations. But Eru intervened, adopting the Dwarves as his own Children, so that when Aulë picked up his great hammer to smite the Seven Fathers and destroy his presumptuous creations, they cowered in fear and begged for mercy. Ilúvatar willed that the Dwarves would not emerge before the Firstborn Elves, and so he decreed that the Seven Fathers should sleep underground, and come forth after the Firstborn had awakened."
